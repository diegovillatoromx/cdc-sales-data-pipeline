# cdc-sales-data-pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline for real-time sales data analysis. Utilizing AWS services such as DynamoDB, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, S3, and Athena, this project demonstrates how to capture, transform, and analyze sales data in real-time. The pipeline starts with generating mock sales data and ingesting it into a DynamoDB table, followed by capturing data changes using EventBridge. The data is then processed through Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose, transformed using a Lambda function, and stored in S3 for analysis with Athena. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for real-time data analytics.
